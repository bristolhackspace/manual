Membership
==========

Accessing the Hackspace
-----------------------

Your keycard grants you 24/7 access to Hackspace.

We charge a £5 issuance fee per keycard, including replacements. If your card is lost of stolen, please tell us as soon as you can so we can cancel it.

If your membership payments fall into arrears, we may deactivate your card until this is remedied.

Please don't mark your keycard with “Hackspace” or the address, as this makes it very easy to break in if you drop it in the surrounding streets.


Ending your membership
----------------------

To end your membership you can contact the committee using the `contact form <https://bristolhackspace.org/contact/>`__. The committee will cancel your direct-debit for you and deactivate your access card.

Your membership will expire exactly one month after your last payment was received. Please remember to take any project materials you have stored at Hackspace away with you.

Termination of Membership
-------------------------

The directors can terminate your membership if they decide your continued participation is harmful, or likely to be harmful, to Hackspace. This may be made as a result of:

* An investigation into formal complaints made against you.
* You failing to respond to multiple requests to settle a significant debt to Hackspace.
* Your membership payments having stopped.

A resolution to terminate a membership must have the support of a strict majority of the directors to pass. Termination takes immediate effect, unless by the grace of the directors.

The directors will give at least 14 days notice of a meeting where sanctions such as terminating your membership is up for discussion. This is to allow you reasonable opportunity to make representations in advance. In exceptional circumstances the directors may ask that you do not use Hackspace until the decision has been made.
