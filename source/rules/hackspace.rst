Hackspace Rules
===============

0: Don't be on Fire!
--------------------

Your safety and the safety of others is your responsibility, so you must always consider the risks and hazards of your actions, and challenge unsafe behaviour in others. Wear appropriate safety gear. Report all incidents. See our :doc:`/rules/health-and-safety` document for more detail.

1: Be Excellent to Each-Other
-----------------------------

This is an inclusive environment, and we will not tolerate any behaviour that we deem to be harassment, bullying, or discrimination. See our :doc:`/policies/conduct` for more detail.

2: Pay Monthly Membership
-------------------------

To participate in our community and use our space, pay a monthly membership fee by bank transfer. See our :doc:`/manual/membership` guide.

3: Give Back to Hackspace
-------------------------

We don't have paid staff and rely on all members to keep the space running smoothly and safely. Give some time back in proportion to the usage you get from the space. See our :doc:`/manual/fair-use` guide.

4: Keep Hackspace Tidy
----------------------

Clear up your mess by putting tools back in the right places, disposing of rubbish appropriately, and storing your stuff considerately in the Project Storage Area. Leave all benches clear when you go.

5: Do Not Hack
--------------

Do not hack (or remove) Hackspace's infrastructure and tools, or other member's project stuff.

6: Donate Thoughtfully
----------------------

Hackspace welcomes donations of useful components and interesting stuff to hack, when space allows. We don't want junk though. Check our :doc:`/manual/storage` guide.

7: Get Inducted
---------------

Do not use any tool you are not comfortable and confident using. Formal inductions are mandatory to use some of our more dangerous or costly machinery. See our :ref:`inductions` guide.

8: Be Legal
-----------

Abide by the law when in Hackspace. Do not make controlled substances (such as drugs), illegal items (such as prohibited weapons), or attempt unauthorised access to computer systems (the other type of hacking).

9: Supervise Guests
-------------------

Guests, visitors, children, and even pets are welcome, but must be supervised by a Hackspace member who accepts responsibility for them. See our :doc:`/manual/guests` page.

10: Follow the Building's Rules Too
-----------------------------------

Hackspace is a tenant of Meridian Studios, so you must follow their rules too. Please don't park on the forecourt or put unsuitable materials in the bins. Remember to check that the shutter, windows, and doors are secure when you go. See the :doc:`/rules/building` for more detail.
