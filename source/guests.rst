Guests, Children and Pets
=========================

Guests are welcome in the Hackspace, however they remain the direct responsibility of the member who brought them and must not use any equipment that requires induction.

    Do not leave your guests unattended in Hackspace.
    Explain all relevant Hackspace rules to your guests.
    If you see someone's guest being unsafe or using induction-protected equipment, challenge them and report this as an incident.
    Do not let people into the space if you don't know them, or if you not sure whether they are a member. If you let a non-member in, they become your guest and you are responsible for them!
    Memberships are never transferable or sharable between people.
