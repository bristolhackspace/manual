Health and Safety
=================

Health & Safety is the responsibility of every member of Bristol Hackspace. It is the duty of each member to make sure they are safe and not endangering the people around them.

First Aid
---------

First Aid Boxes are kept stocked and checked periodically. Please ensure you are familiar with where these are stored - they can be found in the following locations:

* Corridor downstairs next to the main entrance.
* By the divider curtain between the wood and metal shop.

If you use anything from these boxes, please report the injury using the accident reporting form explained below.

Accident and Near Miss Reporting
--------------------------------

It is important that accidents, whether resulting in an injury or near miss, are logged. This helps us improve the safety of the hackspace. It guides our induction processes and prompts us to check the first aid kits more regularly than scheduled.

Incidents can be reported using our online `Safety incident reporting form <https://bristolhackspace.org/safetyreport>`__.

Fire
----

What to do in the Event of a Fire
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Power down the machine you are using.
* Leave immediately via one of the escapes. Do not stop to collect personal belongings.
* Warn others in the space as you leave.
* Raise the alarm, if it is not already sounding, by pressing a red break-glass.
* Once outside, phone the fire brigade. Our alarm is not automatically linked to them.
